# edu-gomoku-components

## Create project with npm

> We install react, and reac-dom, that is enought to identify the project and
> as we don't need all files from a react application that suffise.
> We will however need to set bundler to webpack (not vite).

```bash
cd ~
cd ws
rm -rf gomoku-components
mkdir gomoku-components
cd gomoku-components
mkdir public
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom
npx storybook init
```
